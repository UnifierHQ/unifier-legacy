An archive of the very first version of Unifier

## What is this?
This is pretty much the very first (or at least, the oldest existing) version of Unifier, made when I was the sole developer and the code wasn't up on GitHub.

We made this repository to be some sort of "museum" for our past, but if you want, you can use this however you'd like, as long as you follow the conditions of the [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/unifier-legacy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

We do plan on open sourcing our active repositories as well, so if you'd like to use the same Unifier we use today, stay tuned for updates on the official [wiki](https://unichat-wiki.pixels.onl).
